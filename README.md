## Introduction
The Python code reads data from multiple CSV files, combines them into a single data frame, and performs some initial data exploration using the Pandas library. The input data includes information on customer orders, products, aisles, and order history. The code merges these datasets based on the common columns and creates a new dataframe that combines information from all sources.
